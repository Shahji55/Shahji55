### Hi there 👋

I'm an AI/ML Engineer with 4+ years experience of working on a variety of projects which utilized AI to solve a particular problem. Specifically, my expertise in the field of AI includes computer vision, deep learning and machine learning. 

I've worked on end to end ML pipelines which have involved collection of datasets, training of AI models, integration of trained models in the pipeline, optimization of the models and the deployment of the pipelines. These pipelines have been developed for GPU and edge devices (Nvidia Jetson Nano), and deployed for clients both onsite and on cloud platforms (AWS, GCP).

In my current role as a Senior AI/ML Engineer, I'm responsible for hands-on development on different projects as well as leading a team of AI engineers.
