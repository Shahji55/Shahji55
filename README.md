### Hi there 👋

I am an experienced AI Engineer with a strong background in developing and optimizing end-to-end AI systems using Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Computer Vision and LLMs. These systems were designed to provide
solutions for complex problems, which helped clients to make better, informed business decisions.

I have developed end to end ML pipelines which have involved overseeing collection/annotation of datasets, training/fine-tuning and evaluation of AI models, integration of trained models in the pipeline, optimization of the models/pipelines for production environments and the deployment of the pipelines. These pipelines have been developed for GPU and edge devices, and deployed for clients both onsite and on cloud platforms.

In my role as an AI/ML Engineer, I have been responsible for hands-on development as well as mentouring the junior AI engineers in the team. Additionally, I have collaborated directly with clients and stakeholders to gather requirements, present technical proposals, and incorporate feedback into iterative product development.

### My Skills Profile

Python, Pytorch, Tensorflow, TensorRT, Deepstream, Git, Docker, Google Cloud Platform, Scikit-learn, Numpy, OpenCV, Pandas, SQL, VS Code
